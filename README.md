# task_01

## goal: 

An application that gives us the possibility to search users [params: username, location, programming language] through the service Github. 

I can search for:

* username
* location
* programming language

I can navigate through the results with pagination.

Handle input logic by yourself, it could be one input with the possibility to search through several options or many inputs.

**level one**

The application should be done with pure JavaScript, without any libraries and dev-stack what was prepared by 3rd party services, styling depends on a developer, feel free to use what you want.

**level two**

The application should be done with a framework or library that is required for the position, styling depends on a developer, feel free to use what you want. The code should be covered with tests.

**BONUS**

Implement autocomplete using bouncing or throttling and be ready to describe your choice.
